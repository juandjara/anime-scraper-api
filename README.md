# anime-scraper-api
ExpressJS rest api that provides functionality from npm.im/anime-scraper remotely

## Up and running
```
npm i
npm start
```

NOTE: This app needs acces to the `fs` module for storing the cloudflare cookie so it cannot (yet) be used in services such as `now`

## Contributing
PRs welcome! Just use ES6 as much as you can.
